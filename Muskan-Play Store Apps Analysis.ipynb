You'll be using Python to explore it and find interesting insights.\n","\n","First, the data will be cleaned up using Python to fix any mistakes and make it look neat.\n","\n","Once the data is clean, SQL will be used to find hidden patterns and correlations in the data. However, in this project, we are only going to work on cleaning tasks.\n","\n","Visualizations will also be created to make it easier to understand the data. Charts and graphs will show patterns and trends.\n","\n","By the end, you'll have learned a lot about how to make smart decisions using data. This project helps everyone understand how to use data to make better choices in our digital world.\n","\n","Join this adventure as you explore the Google Play Store dataset.
