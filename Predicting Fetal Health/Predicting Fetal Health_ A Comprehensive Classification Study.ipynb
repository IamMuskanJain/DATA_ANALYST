Our journey begins with a meticulous analysis of a comprehensive fetal health classification dataset—a treasure trove of 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams. These records were carefully classified into three classes: \"Normal,\" \"Suspect,\" and \"Pathological\" by three expert obstetricians, whose expertise and insights are invaluable in shaping our understanding of fetal health.\n","\n","Much like a symphony of strategies in a grand performance, we wield a trio of classifiers: linear regression, random forest, and decision tree. Each classifier possesses its unique strengths and methods, akin to the diverse tactics employed by teams on the field. With precision honed through rigorous training, these algorithms adapt to unveil critical insights, distinguishing between potential fetal health concerns and positive outcomes.\n","\n","Yet, fetal health classification extends beyond individual performance. It demands a deep understanding of the intricate interplay between health indicators, much like deciphering the tactics of rival teams. We delve into the dataset's depths, unveiling hidden patterns and identifying variables that signify fetal well-being or distress. This analytical journey mirrors the art of studying opponents' strategies to gain an edge.\n","\n","While the applause may be silent in the laboratory, the significance of our work cannot be overstated. These classifiers empower healthcare professionals to make informed decisions, ensuring the well-being of both unborn children and expectant mothers. In this realm, your role is indispensable, much like an unsung hero, translating data into actionable insights that shape the course of future generations' health—a testament to the power of data and innovation in the world of healthcare."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"id":"b5NxH3t70dtJ","run_control":{"frozen":true}},"source":["# **Module 1**\n","### Task 1: Data Dive: Exploring Fetal Health Insights\n","As the data scientist leading this critical project, you begin by importing the fetal health dataset with a few lines of code.
