It offers a database solution that efficiently stores, queries and retrieves vector embeddings—the advantages of this lie in the simplicity of database maintenance, management and cost.\n","\n","**To create a new MongoDB database, set up a database cluster:**\n","\n","1. Head over to MongoDB official site and register for a [free MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register), or for existing users, [sign into MongoDB Atlas](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login?nds=true).\n","\n","2. Select the 'Database' option on the left-hand pane, which will navigate to the Database Deployment page, where there is a deployment specification of any existing cluster. Create a new database cluster by clicking on the \"+Create\" button.\n","\n","3.   Select all the applicable configurations for the database cluster. Once all the configuration options are selected, click the “Create Cluster” button to deploy the newly created cluster. MongoDB also enables the creation of free clusters on the “Shared Tab”.\n","\n"," *Note: Don’t forget to whitelist the IP for the Python host or 0.0.0.0/0 for any IP when creating proof of concepts.*\n","\n","4. After successfully creating and deploying the cluster, the cluster becomes accessible on the ‘Database Deployment’ page.\n","\n","5. Click on the “Connect” button of the cluster to view the option to set up a connection to the cluster via various language drivers.\n","\n","6. This tutorial only requires the cluster's URI(unique resource identifier).
