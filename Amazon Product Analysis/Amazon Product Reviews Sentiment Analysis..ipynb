Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\\\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\\\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \\\"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Task 3: Visualizing Sentiments.**\n","\n","In this cinematic data voyage, my code paints a vivid picture of Amazon product ratings.

Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4\\\">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM\\\">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, \\\"...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them.
