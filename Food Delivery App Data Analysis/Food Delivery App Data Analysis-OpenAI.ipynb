You can order food from almost anywhere, anytime, using your phone or computer.\n","\n","But this flexibility is not without drawbacks. The food delivery sector is large and complex, with many factors at play. Understanding how it works and what factors impact people's decisions is critical for both businesses and consumers.\n","\n","In this notebook, we'll explore into the domain of food delivery by examining data from Zomato, a key platform in the business. The Zomato dataset provides a variety of information on restaurants, cuisines, user reviews, and more. With almost 50,000 rows and 13 columns, it presents a complete picture of the meal delivery industry.\n","\n","But before we can start analyzing this data, we need to address a crucial issue: cleanliness. Like many datasets, the Zomato dataset is not perfect. It contains errors, inconsistencies, and missing information that need to be cleaned up before we can make sense of it.\n","\n","That's where our project comes in. We're using LangChain, a powerful tool that simplifies the data cleaning process. With LangChain, we can quickly and efficiently clean the Zomato dataset, making it ready for analysis in no time.\n","\n","So, join us as we explore the world of food delivery, using data to uncover insights that can help businesses thrive and consumers make informed choices."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"id":"JUtT3DDuzMg3","run_control":{"frozen":true}},"source":["### **Install the required libraries**\n","**langchain**: An open source framework for building applications based on large language models (LLMs).\n","\n","**langchain_experimental**: An experimental extension of the langchain library, offering cutting-edge features and functionalities for advanced natural language processing tasks.\n","\n","**openai**: A powerful Python library developed by OpenAI, offering state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities.
